This is a fork of [Brian Fabien](https://www.me.washington.edu/research/faculty/fabien/index.html)'s OCP solver which is otherwise available, with documentation, [here](http://abs-5.me.washington.edu/ocp/).

I have added some convenient makefiles to ease compilation of the project.

To run, type `make` in the root directory of the project.

To run an example type, e.g., `./runOCP examples/ex1` in the root of the
project. The `runOCP` script can be called from anywhere.
